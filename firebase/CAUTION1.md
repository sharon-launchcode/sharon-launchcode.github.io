#### IMPORTANT EXCERPTS AND QUOTES

Building real-time applications is today standard. At Crisp, we used Firebase in production over 9 month, starting from day one. From the dream to the nightmare, here is our experience.

Note that this article covers the production aspect of using Firebase Realtime Database, and we still think that this solution still great to build MVPs, Hackathon Projects, or if you have your own reasons.

Edit: Firebase reached us and was very receptive to the issues we encountered. We are glad to see such an engaged team for their product. Our case is special as we have very specific needs for which we got to the limits of Firebase (which was by the way the pre-2016 Google I/O version). Nonetheless, this is an excellent service if all you need is storing user data and dealing with real-time issues.
