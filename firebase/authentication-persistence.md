##### EXCERPT
'''For a web application, the default behavior is to persist a user's session even after the user closes the browser. This is convenient as the user is not required to continuously sign-in every time the web page is visited on the same device. This could require the user having to re-enter their password, send an SMS verification, etc, which could add a lot of friction to the user experience.'''
