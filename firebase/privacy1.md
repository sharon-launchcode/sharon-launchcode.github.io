Data protection
Firebase is GDPR-ready
On May 25th, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive. Google is committed to helping our customers succeed under the GDPR, whether they are large software companies or independent developers.

The GDPR imposes obligations on data controllers and data processors. Firebase customers typically act as the "data controller" for any personal data about their end-users they provide to Google in connection with their use of Firebase, and Google is, generally, a "data processor".

This means that data is under the customer's control. Controllers are responsible for obligations like fulfilling an individual's rights with respect to their personal data.

If you're a customer, and would like to understand your responsibilities as a data controller, you should familiarize yourself with the provisions of the GDPR, and check on your compliance plans.

Key questions to consider:

How does your organization ensure user transparency and control around data use?
Are you sure that your organization has the right consents in place where these are needed under the GDPR?
Does your organization have the right systems to record user preferences and consents?
How will you show regulators and partners that you meet the principles of the GDPR and are an accountable organisation?
