Create a user

You create a new user in your Firebase project by calling the createUserWithEmailAndPassword method or by signing in a user for the first time using a federated identity provider, such as Google Sign-In or Facebook Login.

You can also create new password-authenticated users from the Authentication section of the Firebase console, on the Users page, or by using the Admin SDK.
