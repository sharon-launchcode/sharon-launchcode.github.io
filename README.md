#### Proof of Concept: Explores potential methods of contact and communication for a Virtual Legal Clinic
#### Working with lawyers doing pro-bono work in an effort to use technology in order to bring legal assistance to those in need.
#### CURRENT STATUS: Work with lawyers on a platform for a Virtual Legal Clinic has been moved to a different platform, <a href="https://www.legaler.com/">Legaler</a>to use as a Virtual Clinic.  Legaler is an amazing platform, developed by lawyers. We were unaware of Legaler's presence when we started working together; the Legaler team already had a platform much more fleshed out than this one.   We unaminously decided to continue working together via the Legaler platform, rather than this one. 

#### As I continue to work with the amazing Legaler team as a non-lawyer "client" tester, I have since re-purposed this site to explore other technical challenges; namely, integration.   This project now continues independently of the work done with the Legaler team.
